    "Pandas was built on the premise of being a very good data handling and analysis tool through Python. According to their [documentation](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/integrate.html) `pandas` **is an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools' for a Python environment**\n",

What is more interesting was that all of the statistical tools were also taught in STAT 200, which used R for most of the analysis. The goal of this `pandas` guide is to take the statistical theory and apply it to a data set, which we will use `pandas` to manipulate instead of using excel or R.\n",

    "* Explore how data can be **imported** into Jupyther and operated on by Pandas. File formats and file preparations. Including how to fix column datas that may be improperly imported.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Discuss methods of data **filtration** and selection. Sometimes survey contains non responses categorized as certain numbers. So for statisticcal analysis certain datapoints will have to be removed first.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Go through basic statistical functions and **statistical summaries** (ie. finding means standard deviations, IQR etc.) and manually calculate them too with `pandas` which will require **reorganizaion** of data as well.\n",

    "* **Graphing** our data sets to visualize it will be most helpful. `pandas` is integrated with `matplotlib` so we will be able to use similar commands here too."
